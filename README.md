# Student Project: FamilyTies
FamilyTies - genealogy software 

## About

This project aims to produce a software application for genealogical research that is written in Java. Java allows us to run the application on any Java enabled platform (MacOS, Windows, Linux) without recompilation or re-packaging. The project is to be open-source and therefore all technologies used will also be open-source.

# Student to complete from here on:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Any tools or versions of languages needed to run code. For example specific Python or Node versions. Minimum hardware requirements also go here.

### Installation

How to build or install the applcation.

### Running Locally

How to run the application on your local system.

### Running Tests

How to run tests on your local system.

## Deployment

### Local

Deploying to a production style setup but on the local system. Examples of this would include `venv`, `anaconda`, `Docker` or `minikube`. 

### Production

Deploying to the production system. Examples of this would include cloud, HPC or virtual machine. 

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial Research  
- [ ] Minimum viable product <-- You are Here  
- [ ] Alpha Release  
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release  

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
